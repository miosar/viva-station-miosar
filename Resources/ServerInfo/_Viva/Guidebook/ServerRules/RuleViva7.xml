  # Rule 8.
  ## You are a person on a space station. Act like it.

  This means you should be roleplaying and acting like your character. While we have more tolerance than other servers for activities that would be considered "self-antagging" this does not mean you should be welder bombing security because "they told you no once". Reasonable ecsilation should be followed at all times and your character should have some sense of self preservation. This server has higher RP standards than most and we expect all players to be able to meet them.

  This also applies to character names. Your character should not be named something that no person from any culture, alien or otherwise, would name their child. If you're not sure if a name violates this ahelp it or ask an admin in the discord.
