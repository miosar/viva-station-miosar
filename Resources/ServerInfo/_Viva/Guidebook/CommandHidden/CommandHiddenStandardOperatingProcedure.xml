  # Introduction

  Welcome to the hidden command SOP!

  Please note: Everything in here is metashielded, and has personal reveal conditions.

  In order to lift the metashield, you have to somehow acquire a guidebook issued to every head of staff that contains this information, or sufficient proof of its existence.
  (AHelp if you think you have enough to have your character realise so the admins know what's going on)

  If you find the guidebook for the Quartermaster, Chief Medical Officer, Chief Engineer, or Research Director, you unveil Clearance Level 1.
  If you find the guidebook for the Captain, Head of Personnel, or Head of Security, you unveil Clearance Level 2 and below.
  If you (Somehow) find the guidebook for the Blue Shield Officer or the Nanotrasen Representative, you unveil Clearance Level 3 and below.

  Higher clearance levels supersede any rules declared in lower ones.

  Reminder:
  Knowing the hidden SOP is not a requirement for RP led riots and revolutions, but know is useful for helping incite them.

  If you're unsure of what your character currently knows, send an AHelp, and any admin online will be happy to assist!
