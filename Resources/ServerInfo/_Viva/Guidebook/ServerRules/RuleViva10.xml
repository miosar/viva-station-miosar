  # Rule 10.
  ## Don't Abuse Admin Contacting

  This includes Ahelps, prayers, faxes, and phones.

  Ahelps are for OOC things that require admin intervention in an administrative way. If you do not require immediate admin intervention use prayers, a phone, or faxes. Ahelps should not be used to ask for gifts or admemes. If you think something is off, if you need clarification, or something else, please, ahelp it, but don't clog up our ahelps asking for things you cannot obtain naturally unless we explicitly tell you to use ahelps for this. It makes our job of moderating the server harder.

  Do NOT spam faxes, prayers, or phones (redphone, blood-redphone, banana phone). It gets annoying very quickly for admins and prevents us from engaging with good intentioned faxes, prayers, and calls.
