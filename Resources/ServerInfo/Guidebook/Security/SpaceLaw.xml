  # Space Law
  Funky Station operates under space law. All crew, passengers, and visitors aboard the station are expected to know and follow these laws (they are fairly common sense, only security and the captain need to know the times).

  ## Treatment Of Prisoners

  Prisoners still have certain rights that must be upheld by law enforcement:


  - Prisoners must be granted medical care if they are in a critical state, actively dying, or dead. Otherwise, it is not required to give prisoners medical care.
  - Prisoners must be granted food and water on request, unless they have proven themselves to not be deserving of it by being excessively antagonistic to Security staff.
  - Physical force is permitted against prisoners in the case that they are being disruptive or verbally combative (e.g. badmouthing officers, punching doors or other objects within the brig, or butchering clothes to make curtains.) This does not allow killing or otherwise maiming prisoners, unless said prisoners present a grave threat to life and limb.
  - Prisoners must be given their shift mandated PDA after confinement has finished. Unless there is solid proof of PDA tampering, in which case the PDA is to be secured and replaced with a fresh one.
  - Prisoners held for extended or permanent confinement should be held in the communal brig, and should not be confined to a solitary cell unless they pose a risk to life and limb.

  ###   Restraints

  This section covers the use of electropacks, muzzles, and handcuffs on prisoners and released criminals.

  - The use of electropacks is authorized for prisoners and parolees that have been charged with Tier IV crimes or higher, pose a significant risk of escaping, and/or have been noted to be particularly violent
  - The use of muzzles is permitted for prisoners who are verbally antagonistic, or prisoners who have been proven to be practitioners of occult magic.
  - The use of handcuffs is authorized for prisoners who pose a threat to life and limb, and for the transferring of inmates to another location (such as a new cell, or to the evacuation shuttle). The use of handcuffs for prisoners is also authorized in the case that the brig becomes uninhabitable, however prisoners should be returned to the brig when possible.

  ## Searches

  A personnel search is a seizure of the objects in a person's backpack, hands, coat, belt, pockets, and hat. If any contraband is found during a search the officer may choose to further the search into a detainment or simply confiscate the restricted items. After the search is conducted all legal items are to be returned to the person.

  A crewmate may legally decline any search conducted without a warrant while the alert level is green. Should be noted that if the alert level is blue or above all personnel searches are legal and no longer require a warrant.

  ## Implantation

  Any prisoner in custody can be subjected to implantation or implant removal procedures. The process of adding an implant should not prolong the detainees sentence, meaning you can not hold them longer to administer the implant, unless stated otherwise.

  [bold]Loyalty Implants[/bold]: If a Tier III crime or above is committed, Loyalty Implants are authorized. For Tier IV, it is recommended. For Tier V, it is mandatory. If a suspect refuses to cooperate or the implant fails to function they can be charged with Refusal of Implantation.

  Loyalty Implants are permitted below Tier III crimes with permission by both the Captain and Central Command, barring situations where command does not have time to contact Central Command.

  [bold]Mindshield Implants[/bold]: Under normal circumstances, a crewmate can refuse a Mind Shield if they are not imprisoned for committing a crime.

  [bold]However, when there is a known threat to the station that utilizes mass brainwashing or mind control, crewmates must submit to a Mind Shield if ordered by Security. Failure to comply is to be treated as Refusal of Mental Shielding.[/bold]

  ###   Removal

  A suspect can be forced to receive implant removal if permitted by either HoS or Captain.

  ## Sentencing
  All sentencing is to primarily be handled by the Warden, if no Warden is available the HoS is to take over that duty, if there's no HoS it falls onto the highest ranking member of Security.

  Use common sense and humanity when issuing punishments. You should not always seek out the highest punishment you can, you don't have to always give the maximum time or always look to demote someone. Always take in account the severity and only charge for what is needed for someone to learn their lesson.
  However, please keep in mind that the point of punishments is to discipline disobedient staff. Do not allow crew members to feel comfortable breaking the law.

  [bold]Accessory, Attempting, And Intention:[/bold] If someone intentionally, knowingly and substantially assists someone in enacting a crime they can be charged with the relevant crimes, such as an engineer giving someone tools, who says they are going to break into an area. Same goes for a clear and solid attempt at a crime, or a person who shows clear intent to act out a crime, such as a syndicate nuclear operative arming a nuke but getting arrested before it goes off, they can still be charged with terrorism. Does not apply to crimes that have an attempted listing already, like attempted murder.

  [bold]Stackable Crimes:[/bold] Crimes are to be considered 'stackable' in the sense that if you charge someone with two or more different crimes, you should combine the times you would give them for each crime.

  [bold]External Influences:[/bold] Crimes committed while under the mental control of another individual or entity are to be pardoned once a clear and successful deconversion occurs.

  [bold]Executions:[/bold] Executions may be authorized by the Captain / acting Captain after a trial has been conducted. Executions may also be approved by CentComm, following formal contact.

  # Repeat Offenses
  Offenses repeated again after having been detained for the same crime can have more time added to the recommended maximum sentencing. The general guideline is as follows:

  ## Second Offenses
  [bold]Recommended Increase:[/bold] Recommended to increase sentencing time by 2x.

  ## Third Offenses
  [bold]Recommended Increase:[/bold] Recommended to increase sentencing time by 3x alongside a loyalty implant.

  ## Further Repeat Offenders
  If the detainee as committed the same crime more than three times in separate occasions, it will be up to the Warden's, or in absence of a Warden, the highest ranking Security Member's discretion on whether they should be put into the Permanent Brig.

  [bold]If brigtime goes above 20 minutes, perma is highly recommended.[/bold]
