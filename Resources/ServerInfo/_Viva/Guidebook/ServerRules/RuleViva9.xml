  # Rule 9.
  ## No End-Of-Round Griefing (EORG)

  Roleplay should continue the exact same way it was before the emergency shuttle reached Central Command. Antagonists should stop persuing their objectives* and all fighting should stop. Prisioners should not attempt to escape, nor should anyone attempt to help said prisioners escape. You should not be attempting to destroy walls, windows, or any CC property.

  Antagonists should not bomb the evac shuttle unless they recieve permission from an admin in an ahelp.*

  Wehnades or other non-harmful disruptive objects on the shuttle and at CC are considered EORG.

  *This does not apply to the following antags:
  - Nuclear Operatives
  - Lone Nuclear Operatives
  - Zombies
  - Acsended Heretics
  - Space Dragons

  These antags may continue to persue their objectives even after the end screen appears, within reason.
