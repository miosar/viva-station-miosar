  # Rule 6.
  ## No Metagaming/Metacomming

  Metagaming, the use of ooc knowledge your would not reasonably have in character, and metacomming, communicating with others in the round via applications admins have no reasonable way to moderate, about the round is STRICTLY not allowed.

  Metacomming specifically is a ZERO TOLERANCE rule.

  Please be aware of our Metasheild. While the existence of antagonists is not sheilded their specific mechanics are. When dealing with things that could be considered meta-information, consider the following question: "Is it reasonable for my character to know about X? Do they have a good reason to know about this information, and a will to act upon it?" Basically, if you're acting on information that could be considered meta, you better have a good, in-character reason. It is reasonable to assume the armed syndicate squad shooting up the station is here for the nuke, it is not reasonable to know the spells a heretic may cast or what items are in an uplink.
