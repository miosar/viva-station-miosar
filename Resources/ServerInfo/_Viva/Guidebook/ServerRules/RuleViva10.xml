  # Rule 10.
  ## Don't Misuse Ahelps
  
  Ahelps are for OOC things that require admin intervention in an administrative way. If you do not require immediate admin intervention use prayers, a phone, or faxes. Ahelps should not be used to ask for gifts or admemes. If you think something is off, if you need clarification, or something else, please, ahelp it, but don't clog up our ahelps asking for things you cannot obtain naturally unless we explicitly tell you to use ahelps for this. It makes our job of moderating the server harder.
