  ## Round Canonicity

  ### When it comes to the STATION AS A WHOLE:
  The following rounds are ALWAYS non-canon and characters are not supposed to remember what happens in them under any circumstances, because if they happened, no one would be alive in the same way anymore:
  - Any round where an Octarine Level Alert successfully manifest
  - Any round where a Blood Cult is successful in summoning their main deity

  ### When it comes to INDIVIDUAL CHARACTERS:
  You may decide specific rounds are either not canon to your character or do not apply to them now (due to the other them being a clone, imposter, or otherwise). You are recommended, but not required, to do this if:
  - Your character is an antagonist in a given round.

  ## Remembering Information
  Characters may NOT remember ANY of the following information, but the rounds and information itself IS canon:
  - The entirety of any round where their character was dead by the time the round restarted
  - The entirety of any rounds where your character has been converted or forcefully implanted in some way that completely alters their personality and goals, and this was not reverted in the round.
  Both of these limitations can be [bold]ignored[/bold] if you were brought to Central Command or some other functional medical facility and were there at round end.

  Characters may NOT remember ANY of the following information unless supernatural forces remind them:
  - Any information seen while a ghost.
  - The specifics of your death, including who killed you and how. You are allowed to remember events roughly five minutes or earlier before that point.

  You may remember [bold]most other situations[/bold]. "Metagrudging" and "metafriending" in the context of character and character interaction is allowed, however, they should be built in character and any conflict that is a thinly veiled excuse for griefing is not allowed.
