  # Rule 1.
  ## Don't be an Asshole

  This means no OOC toxicity. This applies to both on the discord and in game. If your character is an asshole that's okay, but don't use that as an excuse to be an ass in OOC as well.

  This includes spamming sounds, emotes, objects, etc. Many players find repeated sounds very annoying and many entities placed on one tile can begin to lag the server.
